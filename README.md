Modeling Semantic Plausibility Project
Data Analysis:
Dataset: Pep3K
15 features to be analyzed:
Basic features of data:

1. size of dataset
2. balance of dataset, how many data instances are labeled plausible versus implausible
3. number of items in each data instance
4. vocab in dataset
5. word count and token frequency
6. average word length
Linguistic Characteristics:

8. Part-of-Speech tag distribution
9. relation between subjects being animate/inanimate and their labels
10. relation between objects being animate/inanimate and their labels
11. how many times words appear in the dataset as subject or object and their corresponding labels
12. 
(Dis)agreement in annotation:

14. each annotate selection of dataset and see if we agree with the labeled annotations
Relationships across data splits:

15. compare basic features of data across test, train, and dev
16.
